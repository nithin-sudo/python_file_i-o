# üóÇÔ∏è Student Records System in Python

This is a **menu-driven Python application** that helps manage student records using a text file. It covers all basic file operations like reading, writing, updating, deleting, and appending data.

## What It Can Do

When you run the program, you'll see a menu with 7 options:

1. **Display all student records**

   - Shows everything currently in the `students.txt` file.

2. **Add a new student record**

   - Lets you enter a new student (roll number, name, and score). It adds the record to the end of the file.

3. **Update a student's score**

   - Finds a student by roll number and allows you to change their score.

4. **Delete a student record**

   - Removes a student‚Äôs record using their roll number.

5. **Overwrite all records**

   - Clears the file and lets you enter all new student data from scratch.

6. **Read and add records**

   - First shows existing records, then allows you to add more without removing anything.

7. **Exit the program**
